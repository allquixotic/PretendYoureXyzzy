Pretend You're Xyzzy
===================

A Cards Against Humanity clone, server and web client. See WebContent/license.html for full details.

Note: This project is only known to work with Tomcat 7, all other versions are unsupported. 
Currently, the only way to build PYX is using Maven via ```mvn clean package war:war``` in the project's directory.


If you're doing ```mvn clean package jetty:run```, you now need to add ```-Dmaven.buildNumber.doCheck=false -Dmaven.buildNumber.doUpdate=false``` to make the buildnumber plugin allow you to run with uncommited changes.
